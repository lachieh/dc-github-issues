Nevertheless, it's a very confusing behaviour, developers might assume those files are being used or even that SVGs imported the way described above are not being inlined.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour is that inlined resources do not end up in the build folder, resulting in a smaller and clean `build` folder.\r\n\r\n### Related\r\n\r\n- Follow up on https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/7941 which was marked as stale\r\n- Related to https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/9009"

First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, the issue persists for any new project generated with CRA.\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  There are a few common documented problems, such as watcher not detecting changes, or build failing.\r\n  They are described in the Troubleshooting section of the User Guide:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting\r\n\r\n  Please scan these few sections for common problems.\r\n  Additionally, you can search the User Guide itself for something you're having issues with:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/\r\n\r\n  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.\r\n  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI searched for 'missing modules' in the user guide, but honestly didn't expect to find anything since this issue only began in the past couple days.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  current version of create-react-app: 3.4.1\r\n  running from /Users/jjpiv/.config/yarn/global/node_modules/create-react-app\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS 10.15.5\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7920HQ CPU @ 3.10GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 14.4.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.4 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.14.4 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 83.0.4103.97\r\n    Firefox: 77.0.1\r\n    Safari: 13.1.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.13.1 => 16.13.1\r\n    react-dom: ^16.13.1 => 16.13.1\r\n    react-scripts: 3.4.1 => 3.4.1\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesnâ€™t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your steps here:)\r\n\r\n1. yarn create react-app test-app\r\n2. cd test-app\r\n3. yarn start\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  Itâ€™s fine if youâ€™re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI expected the app to compile successfully and launch a new browser tab to view the default CRA app.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Please attach screenshots if possible!

    "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWe're in the middle of a conversion to typescript and found that `noImplicitAny` errors weren't getting reported in `react-scripts build` which was incorrectly succeeding.\r\n\r\nI've now isolated the cause which is a very odd one based on the presence of any typescript files with incorrect extensions in `__tests__` directories. To be clear, the errors that should be getting reported are in regular react files/directories, not the `__tests__` folder (i.e. this isn't the same as #5626).\r\n\r\nSo if there is a file containing jsx with the incorrect extension `ts` instead of `tsx`, and it is in a `__tests__` folder, then _all_ `noImplicitAny` errors get blotted out wherever they are and `react-scripts build` succeeds.\r\n\r\nVS Code reports the errors throughout.\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\nYes\r\n\r\nyarn --version:\r\n\r\n> 2.0.0-rc.35\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\ntypescript, noImplicitAny\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  current version of create-react-app: 3.4.1\r\n  running from C:\\Users\\me\\AppData\\Local\\Yarn\\Data\\global\\node_modules\\create-react-app\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Windows 10 10.0.17134\r\n    CPU: (4) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 12.14.1 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.EXE\r\n    Yarn: 2.0.0-rc.35 - C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Yarn\\bin\\yarn.CMD\r\n    npm: 6.13.4 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Edge: 42.17134.1098.0\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.17134.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: Not Found\r\n    react-dom: Not Found\r\n    react-scripts: Not Found\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nSee my [reproducible example](https://github.com/mungojam/MRE-Typescript-Non-Error) on GitHub below.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt should either give the typescript parse error due to incorrect extension which shows when moving the file out of `__tests__`, or it should give the `noImplicitAny` error that shows when correcting the file extension to `tsx` but leaving in `__tests__`.\r\n\r\nIdeally the first, but that may not be possible yet due to #5626.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n`yarn build` reports no errors and builds successfully despite there being a clear typescript error in the `index.tsx` file. The error is correctly reported if the `__tests__` folder is deleted or if the file in it is renamed to have the correct `.tsx` extension.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible demo\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mungojam/MRE-Typescript-Non-Error\r\n\r\n1. clone the repo\r\n2. yarn install (we use yarn 2, but you can presumably make it work with yarn 1)\r\n3. yarn build\r\n\r\nThe build succeeds, when it should fail.\r\n\r\nThen to make it correctly fail, either switch to either of the other branches, or manually:\r\n\r\n1. Correct the `src/__tests__/a.ts` file extension to tsx\r\n2. yarn build which then gives the correct error about noImplicitAny in index.tsx.\r\n\r\nOr \r\n\r\n1. Move the `src/__tests__/a.ts` file extension to the `src` folder.\r\n2. `yarn build` which then gives the correct error about the file not being parsable, because it has jsx in it with the wrong file extension.\r\n"

Here is its content:\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  root: true,\r\n  extends: ['react-app', 'prettier', 'prettier/flowtype', 'prettier/react'],\r\n  plugins: ['import', 'flowtype', 'jsx-a11y', 'react', 'react-hooks', 'prettier', 'emotion'],\r\n  rules: {\r\n    'emotion/jsx-import': 'error',\r\n    'prettier/prettier': 'warn',\r\n    'react/no-did-mount-set-state': 0,\r\n    'no-unused-vars': 0,\r\n    'dot-notation': 0,\r\n    'no-new-func': 0,\r\n    'no-alert': 0,\r\n  },\r\n  globals: {\r\n    Intl: 'readonly',\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\nIn the editor (VS Code) this configuration is working OK. All the rules are honored.\r\nI also tried to create similar config using `eslintConfig` section in `package.json` file, but it didn't seem to  work either.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: It  looks like that number of errors (per file) is what matters. If I fix few of the `prettier` issues (so that number of issues is less than 5), it no longer fails to compile, and just displays remaining issues as  warnings. It is interesting though that changing from 'warn' to 'error' or to 0 does not seem to have any effect for 'prettier/prettier' rule. Also changing from 0  to 1 for 'no-unused-vars'  has no effect... Maybe the configuration got cached somehow?...\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2: If  I set `cache` option to `false` in `node_modules/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js`, as per https://stackoverflow.com/a/61463282, I'm finally  getting some sensible behaviour: changes in `.eslintrc.js` file result in different errors dispayed  in browser console (or \"Failed to compile\"). Still no hot reloading though: I need to  restart the web server. Now the remaining question is: with the default setting `cache: true`, **where the cache is stored and how long does it last?**\r\n "

    "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWhen installing node-sass into a CRA with typescript project, in usually integrates node-sass automatically for you. Recently mkdirp in the deps is failing and not removing certain files. This is causing the entire module tree to break. \r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\nI did, and it resolves it, so this is a CRA issue not node-sass.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nWindows 10 Home, version 2004 build 19041.\r\nChrome browser.\r\nNode-sass version: 4.14.1\r\nCRA version: 3.4.1\r\nNodeJS version: 13.9.0\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Run: npx create-react-app <name> --typescript\r\n2. Run: npm i node-sass\r\n3. Run: npm run start (alternatively VSC recognises the errors in any import of react)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNode-sass should automatically install safely and allow the use of SCSS files.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nInstalls after a very long period, but leaves a plethora of errors that mkdir (a dependency of CRA or node-sass) is unable to remove files? The files are some other modules. I would post a picture but it's crashing my PC at the minute when I attempt to install it freshly. \r\n\r\n### Reproducible demo\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, it's literally crashing my PC unfortunately. If anyone could create the reproducible demo by just simple creating cra with TS and then install node-sass and running the app I'd greatly appreciate it!\r\n"

Also if I try to \"npm install\" on an existing project. It also hangs. One strange thing is there that there is a .staging file inside node_modules and inside that .staging there are all the dependencies\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\nI have tried to delete node_modules and package-lock.json. But the same issue still persists\r\n<!--\r\n  Your module tree might be corrupted, and that might be causing the issues.\r\n  Let's try to recover it. First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nWindows 10 64bit.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n-->\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nnpx create-react-app\r\n\r\nor in an existing project\r\n\r\nnpm install\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesnâ€™t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nShould create a new react project. \"npm install\" should install all the dependencies\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  Itâ€™s fine if youâ€™re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write what you thought would happen.)\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nEntire terminal hangs\r\n\r\n"

Following the changelog to get migration instructions for newer versions of `react-scripts` was a breeze - thanks for this!\r\n\r\nOne thing that did occur to me however, is that since I first created this project the official `cra-template` has changed quite a bit and now includes things like `src/setupTests.js` and wrapping the app in `<React.StrictMode>`. I looked back over the changelog and saw these changes as enhancements upon closer inspection, but I thought a note in the docs to give users a nudge on this would be useful.\r\n\r\nMight be something here about suggesting updates to `react`/`react-dom` as well if possible?"

    "body": "### Is your proposal related to a problem?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Provide a clear and concise description of what the problem is.\r\n  For example, \"I'm always frustrated when...\"\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMany want more control over their service worker. The current `c-r-a` setup uses Workbox's `GenerateSW` mode, which uses a declarative `webpack` configuration to generate the final service worker. Changing the behavior of the service worker therefore requires updating the `webpack` config, which is not allowed in `c-r-a`.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Provide a clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn Workbox v5, the `InjectManifest` mode will take an \"source\" service worker file (either in JavaScript or TypeScript) and run it through a `webpack` child compilation, which allows you to write your service worker source file just like any other modern JavaScript code, including using [ES module imports](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/using-bundlers) for the Workbox runtime.\r\n\r\nThe `InjectManifest` plugin also takes care of reading the list of assets generated by the `webpack` compilation and injecting a precache manifest into the service worker file that will precache those assets.\r\n\r\nI'd like to switch from `GenerateSW` to `InjectManifest` in the `c-r-a` `webpack` configuration, and create a new `packages/cra-template/template/service-worker.js` (and TypeScript equivalent) that roughly contained:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport {clientsClaim} from 'workbox-core';\r\nimport {precacheAndRoute, createHandlerBoundToURL} from 'workbox-precaching';\r\nimport {registerRoute, NavigationRoute} from 'workbox-routing';\r\n\r\nclientsClaim();\r\n\r\nprecacheAndRoute(self.__WB_MANIFEST);\r\n\r\nconst handler = createHandlerBoundToURL(process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/index.html');\r\nconst navigationRoute = new NavigationRoute(handler, {\r\n  denylist: [\r\n    // Exclude URLs starting with /_, as they're likely an API call\r\n    new RegExp('^/_'),\r\n    // Exclude any URLs whose last part seems to be a file extension\r\n    // as they're likely a resource and not a SPA route.\r\n    // URLs containing a \"?\" character won't be blacklisted as they're likely\r\n    // a route with query params (e.g. auth callbacks).\r\n    new RegExp('/[^/?]+\\\\.[^/]+$'),\r\n  ],\r\n});\r\nregisterRoute(navigationRoute);\r\n\r\nself.addEventListener('message', (event) => {\r\n  if (event.data && event.data.type === 'SKIP_WAITING') {\r\n    self.skipWaiting();\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would lead to a service worker that, by default, behaved equivalently to what the previous `GenerateSW` config created. The benefits are that any part of that `service-worker.js` could be edited by the end developer, leading to, e.g., custom service worker runtime caching.\r\n\r\nI would also like to rename the current `packages/cra-template/template/serviceWorker.js` file to `packages/cra-template/template/serviceWorkerRegistration.js` to make it clearer that the file is used in the `window` context to perform registration, and that it does not include the code for the service worker itself.\r\n\r\nIn general, giving developers control over their source service worker in this manner should be relatively decoupled from the underlying `webpack` config. Even if developers made significant changes to their source service worker, by adding in new Workbox modules or other third-party code, the same `webpack` configuration should still be compatible. The one requirement is that the developer would need to keep the string `self.__WB_MANIFEST` somewhere in their source service worker file, as `InjectManifest` checks for this and will fail if it's not present. (It could be inside of a comment like, e.g. `/* self.__WB_MANIFEST */` as a workaround for developers who don't want to use precaching.)\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Let us know about other solutions you've tried or researched.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/8822 is an alternative that will just update to Workbox v5.1.2 and keep using the `GenerateSW` mode, which is okay, but I think developers would be happier if they had the ability to control their service worker. Workbox v5 allows that to be done cleanly in a way that wasn't possible with prior releases.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Is there anything else you can add about the proposal?\r\n  You might want to link to related issues here, if you haven't already.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/7966 for a similar proposal.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two mode is described in more detail at https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin#which_plugin_to_use"

    "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\n`react-scripts` cannot load `tsx` files that are in adjacent yarn workspace packages. \r\n\r\n`Module parse failed: Unexpected token. You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type`\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\nYes, `yarn --version 1.22.4`\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  current version of create-react-app: 3.4.1\r\n  running from /home/ty/.nvm/versions/node/v10.20.1/lib/node_modules/create-react-app\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.6 Arch Linux\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8305G CPU @ 2.80GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 10.20.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.20.1/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.4 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.20.1/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.14.4 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.20.1/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: Not Found\r\n    Firefox: Not Found\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: Not Found\r\n    react-dom: Not Found\r\n    react-scripts: Not Found\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: 3.4.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current behavior \r\n\r\n`react-scripts` *can* load TypeScript files with `ts` or `tsx` extensions when those files are located in the same 'home' package as `react-scripts` (the `web` package in the demo). `react-scripts` *can* load `ts` files in packages outside of the home package so long as the `baseUrl` parameter is set to `./` in `tsconfig.json`. `react-scripts` *cannot* load `tsx` files outside of the home package even if the `jsx` parameter is set to `react`. \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Initialize a yarn monorepo\r\n2. Create a react app as a package in that monorepo with the typescript template `create-react-app web --template typescript`\r\n3. Create a package `components` alongside the previously created `web` package and add typescript and a `tsconfig.json`\r\n4. Add the `components` package to `web`'s dependencies.\r\n5. In `src/components` create an `index.ts` file with a default export function that logs something to the console (i.e. no JSX).\r\n6. Import that function in `web` and log to the console at run time. \r\n7. Experience no error.\r\n8. Change the `src/components/index.ts` to `src/components/index.tsx` and make the function run some JSX.\r\n9. Update `web` to render the exported JSX function.\r\n10. Experience the error. \r\n \r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nCRA should be able to import and run JSX (i.e. tsx) code from adjacent packages. \r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nCRA is only able to import and run ts code and not tsx code. \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n../components/src/index.tsx 4:2\r\nModule parse failed: Unexpected token (4:2)\r\nYou may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are configured to process this file. See https://webpack.js.org/concepts#loaders\r\n| \r\n| const App = () => (\r\n>   <div>Hello world</div>\r\n| );\r\n|\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Attempted Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nI tried adding `ts-loader` using `react-app-rewired` but that resulted in an error where Typescript was emitting nothing, a result of CRA automatically setting the noEmit flag to true at compile time. Ejecting is a rabbit hole I never want to go down.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible demo\r\n\r\nA demo of the bug is avaliable at [woodpav/typescript-monorepo-ssr](https://github.com/woodpav/typescript-monorepo-ssr). As described it is a yarn workspace monorepo with two packages: Web and Components. Web contains `react-scripts` and Components contains JSX components. Both packages have a `tsconfig.json` that extends `tsconfig.base.json`. \r\n\r\nTo run the demo:\r\n\r\n1. `yarn install`\r\n2. `cd packages/web`\r\n3. `yarn start`\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ package.json\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ packages\r\nâ”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components\r\nâ”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ package.json\r\nâ”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ src\r\nâ”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ index.tsx\r\nâ”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json \r\nâ”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ web\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ package.json\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ public\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.ico\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.html\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ robots.txt\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ README.md\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ src\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ react-app-env.d.ts\r\nâ”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.base.json\r\nâ””â”€â”€ yarn.lock\r\n\r\n7 directories, 15 files\r\n```\r\n"

First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  There are a few common documented problems, such as watcher not detecting changes, or build failing.\r\n  They are described in the Troubleshooting section of the User Guide:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting\r\n\r\n  Please scan these few sections for common problems.\r\n  Additionally, you can search the User Guide itself for something you're having issues with:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/\r\n\r\n  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.\r\n  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues?q=%22On+Your+Network%3A%22+host\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  current version of create-react-app: 3.4.1\r\n  running from /home/redacted/.npm/_npx/18523/pnpm-global/4/node_modules/.pnpm/create-react-app@3.4.1/node_modules/create-react-app\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Linux 4.15 Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (Bionic Beaver)\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1246 v3 @ 3.50GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 12.17.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v12.17.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.4 - ~/.yvm/shim/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.14.4 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v12.17.0/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 81.0.4044.138\r\n    Firefox: Not Found\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: 16.13.1 => 16.13.1 \r\n    react-dom: 16.13.1 => 16.13.1 \r\n    react-scripts: 3.4.1 => 3.4.1 \r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesnâ€™t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your steps here:)\r\n\r\n1.\r\n2.\r\n3.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  Itâ€™s fine if youâ€™re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt shows 0.0.0.0:\r\n```\r\nStarting the development server...\r\nCompiled successfully!\r\nYou can now view test in the browser.\r\n  Local:            http://0.0.0.0:8080\r\n  On Your Network:  http://172.30.0.6:8080\r\nNote that the development build is not optimized.\r\nTo create a production build, use npm run build.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Please attach screenshots if possible! They are extremely helpful for diagnosing issues.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt shows always localhost.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible demo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you can, please share a project that reproduces the issue.\r\n  This is the single most effective way to get an issue fixed soon.\r\n\r\n  There are two ways to do it:\r\n\r\n    * Create a new app and try to reproduce the issue in it.\r\n      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or canâ€™t share the real code.\r\n\r\n    * Or, copy your app and remove things until youâ€™re left with the minimal reproducible demo.\r\n      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a new project.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once youâ€™re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Paste the link to an example project and exact instructions to reproduce the issue.)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n\r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,\r\n  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.\r\n\r\n  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might\r\n  create a reproducible example for it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\n"

First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  There are a few common documented problems, such as watcher not detecting changes, or build failing.\r\n  They are described in the Troubleshooting section of the User Guide:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting\r\n\r\n  Please scan these few sections for common problems.\r\n  Additionally, you can search the User Guide itself for something you're having issues with:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/\r\n\r\n  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.\r\n  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNo npm audit high issue\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Please attach screenshots if possible! They are extremely helpful for diagnosing issues.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nnpm audit showing high issue\r\n\r\n### Reproducible demo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you can, please share a project that reproduces the issue.\r\n  This is the single most effective way to get an issue fixed soon.\r\n\r\n  There are two ways to do it:\r\n\r\n    * Create a new app and try to reproduce the issue in it.\r\n      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or canâ€™t share the real code.\r\n\r\n    * Or, copy your app and remove things until youâ€™re left with the minimal reproducible demo.\r\n      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a new project.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once youâ€™re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Paste the link to an example project and exact instructions to reproduce the issue.)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n\r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,\r\n  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.\r\n\r\n  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might\r\n  create a reproducible example for it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\n"
